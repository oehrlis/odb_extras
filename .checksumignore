# Checksum Exclusion Patterns
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file specifies patterns for files that should be excluded from
# integrity checks. Each line represents a pattern to exclude.
#
# Syntax:
#   - One pattern per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Supports glob patterns:
#     * matches any characters within a filename/directory
#     ? matches exactly one character
#   - Patterns ending with / match directory contents
#
# Default Exclusions (always applied):
#   .extension       - Metadata file (may be modified by tools)
#   .checksumignore  - This file itself
#   log/             - Log directory (runtime generated files)
#
# Examples:
#   tmp/              - Exclude entire tmp directory
#   *.log             - Exclude all .log files
#   data/*.cache      - Exclude cache files in data directory
#   keystore/         - Exclude keystore directory (credentials)
#   backup/*.bak      - Exclude backup files
#   secrets/          - Exclude secrets directory
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Log directory (already excluded by default, shown for reference)
log/

# Uncomment patterns below as needed for your extension:

# Temporary files
# tmp/
# *.tmp

# Credentials and secrets
# keystore/
# secrets/
# *.key
# *.pem

# Cache files
# cache/
# *.cache

# Backup files
# *.bak
# *.backup

# User-specific configurations (if they override defaults)
# etc/*.local
